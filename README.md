**3‑D‑Printed Segway i2 Hub‑Cap (Replacement)**

Instead of relying on the original insert pins which tend to break easily, this design uses the factory‑fitted Segway
nuts for alignment and 1.26 in × 1/8 in neodymium disc magnets to hold the cap in place.

**Parts needed:**

* ABS/ASA Filament
* Magnets 1.26 inch x 1/8 inch

**Magnets**
A pack of 12 magnets can be purchased for $16.99 here:

**Print Orientation & Color**

1. Place the model on the build plate with the logo facing down (logo towards the bed).
2. Adjust the “Color/Paint Height” (or equivalent setting) to change the logo’s color.
3. The logo is raised by 0.200 mm above the surrounding surface, so you will need to print a different color in that space to create the contrast.
   
With these settings the hub‑cap will fit snugly, align using the original nuts, and stay securely in place thanks to the neodymium magnets.
